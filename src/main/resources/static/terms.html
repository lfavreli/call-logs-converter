            limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven&apos;t purchased
            anything through the Service.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
            for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
            damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal

            third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any

            damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
            consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
            party&apos;s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
            without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
            behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
            expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
            Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
            non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
            trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and
            makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
            results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without
            interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
            can or will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company&apos;s provider makes any
            representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will
            be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or

            from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or
            other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
            But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
            extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>

            Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international
            laws.</p>
        <h2>Disputes Resolution</h2>

            restricted parties.</p>
        <h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>
        <h3>Severability</h3>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and
            interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable
            law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <h3>Waiver</h3>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
            these Terms shall not affect a party&apos;s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
            any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
        <h2>Translation Interpretation</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
            You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
